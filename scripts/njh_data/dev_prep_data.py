# HSQ - import and prep NJH data
#
# Description:
# The purpose of this script is import the NJH data extract. The NJH data
# extract is a file that combines the state specific quitline intake questions.
# 
# A secondary purpose of this script is to rename the NJH extract columns.
# Each state may have a different set of intake questions and therefore has a
# unique codebook to refer to the column names. The column names are ambiguous
# because they are named as SI 1, SI5a, or OI 7b as examples. In order to make
# these columns human readable, this script will import state specific code
# books to determine the intake questions that correspond to the ambiguous
# column names.

# TO-DO:
# 1. Determine which states offered the default, american india, and youth 
# versions of each question. Determine if SI 18e is the question that branches
# the american indian version to determine the denominators. Reached out to 
# Amanda Proctor at NJH on 7/31/2025.
# 2. Some questions are asked on intake while others are asked on eligibility
# Determine which question comes from what codebook.
