# HSQ-Reports
This repository includes the reports for the Helpers Stay Quit project. 

* **HSQ Network Diagrams**: this reads in from REDCap who needs a baseline or 12-month network diagram, creates it using their PNA data, and pushes it back to REDCap
* **HSQ HSQ missing multiple SMS**: this makes a table of people who have missed two SMS surveys and outputs it as a Word document to Egnyte
* **HSQ SMS gift cards**: this takes the count of gift cards from the SMS REDCap and pushes that information into the participant management REDCap
