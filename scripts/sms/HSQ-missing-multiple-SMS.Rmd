```{r}
#N.B. This is a version of the missing sms survey for 2-weeks that is on Janet's
# machine to run manually.

# If anything is updated here, it must also be updated in the .QMD file that is
# setup to run automatically on HPC18
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# PART 1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# For those who have filled out any survey, grab the last date
# Download and process sms and save as sms2
# 1. Download data from report ID 89928
#   - data is in long format, one row for each sms
#   - each sms is 1 per week for the first 24 weeks, then 1 every other week for
#     the remainder of the study
# 2. Fill in the hsqid, smssurvey_count, randomization_dtd to empty cols
# 3. Group by hsqid then fill miss_survey_contact_date & patientend_dtd
# 4. Filter out rows where the patientend_dtd is empty
# 5. Create sms_date by extracting the date from the time stamp
# 6. Group by hsqid and slice the max date (the the row with the most recent
#     sms survey date)
# 7. Create days_since by first taking the difference between today's date and
#     the sms date, then taking the difference between today's date and the
#     miss_survey_date, and taking the minimum of those two values. This will
#     give the most recent event, either the miss_survey_date or the sms_date.
#     The lesser of the difference between today and the sms_date, or the miss_
#     survey date. Out of the sms_survey_date and the date they were contacted,
#     which is the most recent event (date of most recent event)
#     - Days since can be conceptualized as days since last interaction with the
#       study
# 8. Create weeks_in_study - The number of weeks since the randomization date
#     Gives how long the participant has been enrolled in the study
# 9. Create two_surveys - Has the participant missed two surveys?
# 10. Create last_survey - Gets the week of the most recent completed survey


# PART 2 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# for those who have not completed any surveys or ended, grab their
#   randomization date, process sms, and save as sms4
# 1. start with SMS and filter out rows where the record_id is in sms2 and where
#     the patient_end_date is not missing. These are participants that are still
#     in the study, but have not filled out an sms survey at all.
#     *** This may not be working, because one would expect recent enrollments
#     based on randomization date, but instead there are rows where the
#     randomization was as far back as 2023, and they still have a missing,
#     patient end date.
# !!!! The following steps are just like 7, 8, 9, and 10 above
# 2. Create days_since by first taking the difference between today's date and
#     the sms date, then taking the difference between todays date and the
#     miss_survey_date, and taking the minimum of those two values. This will
#     give the most recent event, either the miss_survey_date or the sms_date.
#     The lesser of the difference between today and the sms_date, or the miss_
#     survey date. Out of the sms_survey_date and the date they were contacted,
#     which is the most recent event (date of most recent event)
# 3. Create weeks_in_study - The number of weeks since the randomization date
#     Gives how long the participant has been enrolled in the study
# 4. Create two_surveys - Has the participant missed two surveys?
# 5. Create last_survey - Gets the week of the most recent completed survey

# PART 3 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. stack/bind rows from PART 1 and PART 2
# 2. Filter rows where the participant has missed two_sms_surveys and the amount
#     of time they have been in the study is less than 48 weeks.
# 3. convert hsqid to character
# 4. Remove -record_id, -two_surveys, and -weeks_in_study
# 5. Rename columns
# 6. Display the remaining data as a table in a Word doc hence .Rmd
