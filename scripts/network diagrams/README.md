# Network Diagrams
The HSQ Network Diagrams.Rmd file is the primary script that does the following:
1. Pulls from RedCap data to generate the Baseline (0-month) and 12-month 
  network diagrams.
2. Generates the digrams
3. Uploads the generated diagrams back to RedCap

Currently this script is manually executed.
